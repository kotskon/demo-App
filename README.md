# demo-App
Simple app for practicing with tkinter library and git.
Through a simple gui, the user inputs the first and last page of the file tobe printed and it outputs, in 2 seperate lines, 
the pages to be printed in the correct order. 
This makes it easy for me to print on  my old printer 2 pages per sheet, forwards and backwards.
